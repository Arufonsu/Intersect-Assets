# Free 2D Fantasy MMORPG Assets
A complete collection of sprites, tilesets, animations, interface elements, sounds, music, tools and more for creating free 2d mmorpgs using the Intersect game engine.

This pack originated when [George at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/20-george/) released his [16x16 game assets](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/topic/742-16x16-custom-assets/). Shortly after, [PixelFox at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/264-pixelfox/) released some [sprites, aniamtions, and more](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/topic/740-small-fantasy-resources/) that all fit together extremely well. A short fundraiser was held at AGD and we were able to commission more tiles, characters, and much more from [Zetasis](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/13-zetasis/) and [Murdoc](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/3-xenogene/).

We continued by commissioning a UI design from [Aesthetic at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/377-aesthetic/) and then proceeded to locate items, animations, sounds, and music with loose licensing restrictions from across the net. 

All of the assets in this pack are free to use legally in your projects, even commercially. Please see the licensing information below for more information.
