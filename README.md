# Free 2D Fantasy MMORPG Assets
A complete collection of sprites, tilesets, animations, interface elements, sounds, music, tools and more for creating free 2d mmorpgs using the Intersect game engine.

This pack originated when [George at AGD](https://www.ascensiongamedev.com/profile/20-george/) released his [16x16 game assets](). Shortly after, [PixelFox at AGD]() released some [sprites, aniamtions, and more]() that all fit together extremely well. A short fundraiser was held at AGD and we were able to commission more tiles, characters, and much more from [Zetasis]() and [Murdoc]().

All of the assets in this pack are free to use legally in your projects, even commercially. Please see the licensing information below for more information.
